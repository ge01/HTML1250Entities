    <!-- A common character entity used in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;

    A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.

    Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together at the end of a line. This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.

    Examples:

    ï¿½ 10
    10 m/s
    10 km/h
    10 PM
    Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent that browsers truncate spaces in HTML pages. -->
